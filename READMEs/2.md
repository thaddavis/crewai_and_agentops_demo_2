# TLDR

Notes related to STEP 2 of the "Building Agents with the CrewAI CLI" video

## Install the crewai CLI

- `pip install crewai==0.67.1`

OR

- `pip install crewai`

## Scaffold the crew

And after installing `crewai` on our Dev Container, test out the CrewAI CLI like so...

- `crewai --help`

Because in this DEMO we're going to be creating a group of acclaimed musicians to help us write a hit song...

- `crewai create crew <project_name>`
- ie: `crewai create crew hit_music_only`

## Rebuild the Dev container

- Note how the CrewAI CLI created everything within a folder called `hit_music_only`

- Note 2 things:

  1. these generated files follow the guidelines of the Python Poetry framework
    - Poetry, for those who don't know, is a popular way of organizing Python code that has gained a lot of traction over the past few years...
  2. the content of the generated files includes a crew consisting of 2 agents: a "Research" agent and an "Analyst" agent

- Because the "CrewAI CLI" generated this `hit_music_only` project into a subfolder though, and not the project root itself, we have to make a little adjustment that will make sense in a moment...

- All we have to do to make this adjustment is update the "workspaceFolder" key in the `devcontainer.json` file

```
"workspaceFolder": "/code/<PROJECT_NAME>",
```

ie:

```
"workspaceFolder": "/code/hit_music_only",
```

- After updating the `devcontainer.json`, go over to the Docker Desktop Application, shut down the Dev container, and then delete it

- Then reopen the folder containing the project in VSCode just like you would open any other project folder

- Type SHIFT + COMMAND + P to open the command palette and select the option `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

## Examining the Dev container after re-opening

- After relaunching the Dev container, we see we're in the generated CrewAI Python Poetry project and NOT the project root
- If we type `pwd` into the terminal connected to the Dev container you can see this is indeed true

## Dev containers can lose state

- But also check this out: if we type `crewai --help` [we see the output: `crewai` not found]
- This is because when we rebuilt our Dev container, it lost it's state
- Shutting down and turning on a Dev container will preserve its state BUT if rebuilding it will cause it to lose its state
- So we have to now reinstall `crewai`
- `pip install crewai==0.67.1` OR: `pip install crewai`

## FYI 

- FYI, IF we want to avoid reinstalling the CrewAI CLI each time we rebuild the Dev container, we can add an additional line to the `Dockerfile.dev` to give us a container with Python AND the CrewAI CLI installed when launching...

```.Dockerfile.dev
FROM python:3.12-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential
WORKDIR /code # set the working directory
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir crewai==0.63.6
```

## Python Poetry projects require us to run an installation process before running

- Because the generated CrewAI project is based on Python Poetry, we have to now run the standard Poetry setup process by entering the following commands...
- 1st we have to install poetry with this command: `pip install poetry`
- and then we have to run the following command...
- `poetry install` or `poetry install -vvv`

## Run the crew

- Ok! Now let's try running our generated CrewAI project with the CrewAI CLI and see what happens...
- Let's enter: `crewai run` 
- Believe it or not, we're in great shape despite the "missing OpenAI API key" error
