## Signup with OpenAI

Connecting a CrewAI project with OpenAI is simple...

Signup on OpenAI's platform: `https://platform.openai.com/`

OpenAI's pricing is usage-based just like a gas station so I suggest adding whatever the minimum allowed amount is..

You can always add more credits later.

`https://platform.openai.com/api-keys`

## Provision an API key

Provision an API_KEY...

`https://platform.openai.com/api-keys`

And make sure you keep this key private so no one besides you can create charges on your account

Copy the API KEY and here is how we securely add it to our CrewAI project

## Add environment variables

- in the .env of the Python Poetry project we paste in the API key like so...
- `OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>`

## Run the crew

- After setting up the OPENAI_API_KEY, let's try running the crew again...
- `crewai run`
- Running the crew this time should work âˆš
