# TLDR

Notes related to STEP 6 of the "Building Agents with the CrewAI CLI" video

## Sign up on app.agentops.ai

- Create an account on app.agentops.ai
- Find the API keys section...
- Copy an API key
- add this API key to the .env in the Poetry project on a new line like so...
- `AGENTOPS_API_KEY=<YOUR_AGENTOPS_API_KEY>`

## Add a few lines to the `main.py` file of the CrewAI project

- Add these towards the top of the `main.py` file in the Poetry project...

```
import os
import agentops

agentops.init(os.getenv("AGENTOPS_API_KEY"))
```

## Install AgentOps

poetry add agentops==0.3.13

## Fixing import warnings in VSCode

- Note how even though we added the `agentops` package correctly, we still have a warning showing in VSCode
- This is because the Poetry framework stores downloaded packages in a location that VSCode doesn't know about by default

- And here's how we fix this minor issue...

- First, we find out where Poetry stores it's downloaded packages by entering: `poetry env info`
- And then we copy this "path" value into the interpreter setting of VSCode like so...
- SHIFT + COMMAND + P
  - `Python: Select Interpreter`
  - Enter interpreter path...

- After we let VSCode know where to look, the import warning goes away

## Moment of reflection

- In summary, we used one tool aka `pip` to install `crewai` onto our Dev Container for accessing the CrewAI CLI and now we are using another tool aka `poetry` for installing packages into our generated CrewAI project

- I know it's confusing but welcome to Python development
