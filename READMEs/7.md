Notes related to STEP 6 of the "Building Agents with the CrewAI CLI" video

## Run the crew again

- Before we finally run this crew of agents and generate a hit song...

- let's review our customizations one last time...

- the `agents.yaml` looks good

- the `tasks.yaml` looks good

- the `crew.py` looks good

- the `main.py` looks good but notice this...

- CrewAI allows us to pass dynamic values to our agents when we run them

- For example instead of hard-coding all the requirements of our crew into the config, we could've made some aspects dynamic by inserting placeholders like...

- Let's say we wanted to easily customize the genre when running our crew...

- We could've put a placeholder in our config like so {genre} and CrewAI's framework would've replaced these placeholders with the values provided at kickoff

For example, to easily control the genre that our musicians are specialized in we could do something this when calling the crew...

```
inputs = {
  'genre': 'Hip Hop' 
}
FrequencyMusicCrewCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

or...

```
inputs = {
  'genre': 'Country' 
}
HitMusicOnlyCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

But let's keep things simple and delete all this "inputs" stuff. You can explore these advanced features offered by CrewAI outside of this video...

```
HitMusicOnlyCrew().crew().kickoff()
```

## Run the customized crew

- `crewai run`
